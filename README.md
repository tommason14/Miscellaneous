## MeanCalcs.py
Takes in csv files as command line arguments and then outputs a mean-averaged excel file. 


## Shifts.py
Calculates CSI values for proteins i.e. the difference between the shift of a random coil structure (guaranteed by adding guanidinium chloride) and the shift in that particular conformation.
